Congratulations on finding my little corner of the web! Hello and welcome! I’m Joey, and I’m so glad you’re here. This site is a reflection of my passions, experiences, and aspirations—a space where I hope to connect with like-minded individuals and share my journey. At least, it is what I meant to let it be.

I’m a programming enthusiast with a special love for game development. After earning my Computer Science degree from NC State, I’ve been on an exciting path of continuous learning, growth, and innovation in the tech world.

When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me diving into my other passion—music. Playing the piano and guitar is my go-to for unwinding and expressing creativity. It’s how I find balance amidst the hustle of tech life.

This website is more than just a portfolio; it’s a platform to document my milestones, share insights, and reflect on lessons learned. While the portfolio section might be empty right now, I promise it will feature something exciting very soon—so stay tuned! Through this blog, I hope to inspire, inform, and connect with others who share similar interests. Let’s embark on this journey of growth and discovery together!

Feel free to explore my portfolio, check out my CV, and reach out through the contact page. Whether you have feedback, ideas, or just want to chat, I’d love to hear from you.

Thanks for stopping by—I hope you enjoy your visit!

Warm regards,

Joey
