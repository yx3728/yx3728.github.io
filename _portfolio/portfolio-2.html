<section class="project-detail">
  <p>Implemented a systems-level Sudoku platform with a constraint engine separated from presentation logic, making it easy to plug in new puzzle generators and debugging tools.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a multithreaded workload balancer that parallelizes solving while keeping synchronization costs predictable, trimming puzzle turnaround by ~70%.</li>
    <li>Built a memory-safe testing harness with 5,000+ generated puzzles, custom leak checks, and high-coverage unit tests to hold accuracy near 98%.</li>
    <li>Instrumented runtime metrics, letting us tune heuristics quickly during QA and ship stable daily builds.</li>
  </ul>
